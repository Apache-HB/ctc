# I8086, X86, X86_64 definitions

## Types

types for underlying x86 types are exposed through the `std::arch::x86` module.

these include `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, and `u64`
which are unsigned types of their respective size in bits.

also included are `s8`, `s16`, `s32`, and `s64` which are signed types of their respective size in bits.

additional types include `flag` which represents flags in the x86 ISA `eflags` and `rflags` registers. an example would be the carry and overflow flags.

all x86 integer types are 2s complement.
