# I8086, X86, X86_64 definitions

## Types

types for underlying x86 types are exposed through the `std::arch::x86` module.

these include `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, and `u64`
which are unsigned types of their respective size in bits.

also included are `s8`, `s16`, `s32`, and `s64` which are signed types of their respective size in bits.

`ssize` and `usize` are also included, `ssize` is the largest signed value of the current target, being `s32` on x86 and `s64` on x86_64.
`usize` is the largest unsigned value of the current target, being `u32` on x86 and `u64` on x86_64.

additional types include `flag` which represents flags in the x86 ISA `eflags` and `rflags` registers. an example would be the carry and overflow flags.

all x86 integer types are 2s complement.

## Extension types

types for underlying x86 extension types are exposed through the `std::arch::x86::ext` module.

these include `v128`, `v256`, and `v512` unions which map to `xmm`, `ymm` and `zmm` registers respectively.

the size of `v128` is 16 bytes and will be aligned to 16 bytes.

`v128` may contain either 16 1 byte values, 8 2 byte values, 4 4 byte values or 2 8 byte values. it may only contain one set of these values at a time and may be accessed using the `.at<T>(idx: i8)` extension function.
