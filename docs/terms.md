## Platform defined behavior (PDB)

Refers to behavior that is defined per target but has no guarantees to behave the same across multiple targets.

## Implementation defined behavior (IDB)

Refers to behavior that is defined per compiler but has no guarantees to behave the same across multiple compilers even when targeting the same platform.

## Undefined behavior (UB)

Refers to behavior that is not defined and may be interpreted by each compiler and platform differently. Any and all behavior is valid UB.
